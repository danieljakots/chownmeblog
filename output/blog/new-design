<p><b>Posted on 2018-04-13</b></p>
<p>In June this blog will be five years old. Since <a href="./blog.html">I created it</a>, it
has had the same design. A few weeks ago I looked for a new theme. I found
<a href="https://github.com/Parbhat/pelican-blue">pelican-blue</a> which I liked. For my
first theme, I took it from someone and shortly after someone took it from me.
This time I wanted something more unique.</p>
<p>I took pelican-blue and hammered the CSS so people would notice I love the
color <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red"><em>red</em></a>. At home, my sheets are red, my bath towel is red, my couch is
red, my curtains are red. Even the ribbon Jean Canard plays with is <a href="https://pics.chown.me/Jean-Canard/IMG_0675.JPG">red</a>.</p>
<p>I noticed a couple of things that were broken with the theme so I had to fix
them. Now I have to go back to my commit log to tell the original author as a
way to contribute back.</p>
<p>At first, my blog URL was <code>blog.chown.me</code>. Then I wanted https but I couldn't
have another domain because back then free (and valid—hi cacert) certificates
weren't a thing, I moved it to <code>chown.me/blog</code>. To welcome stalk^Wvisitors I
had a landing page on <code>chown.me</code>. Now, however, I changed my mind and I prefer
to have my blog index page directly on <code>chown.me</code>.</p>
<p>I wanted to break as few links as possible—ain't nobody got time to write the
otherwise needed haproxy redirection. I think I tweaked enough of my
<a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">pelican</a> config file so that most of them are fine.
Not all of them are; I had to break one or two because of translations.
Fortunately, I was lazy enough to translate only a handful of articles so the
breakage is minimal.</p>
<p>To fix some past mistakes I had to go through old articles. It was a weird
feeling to read my younger self. I wouldn't advise to read them haha. They're in
French anyway.</p>
<p>One of my 2018 New Year's resolution was to write more blog articles. With not a
single one for the first quarter, you can guess it's not my best
accomplishment. But hopefully, I'll finally do it.</p>
