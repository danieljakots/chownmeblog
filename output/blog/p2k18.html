<p>After two mostly boring flights, I was in Nantes on Sunday. I didn't do much
because I wanted to get some rest after an exhausting week and tried to get my
body into this new timezone. After a long night of sleep, I went to the hackroom.
It was already well crowded for the first morning.</p>
<p>On Friday the week before, I asked my boss at 5 pm if I had to take days off. He said
"no" as a way to support my work on Open Source—it had been the same for
<a href="./t2k17.html">t2k17</a>. I made a deal with myself that I would finish what I was
working on for a customer instead of asking my coworker. So a large part of my
Monday was finishing that stuff. Still, <a href="https://github.com/openbsd/ports/commit/a322d2ddc88df925eb9c719578e9f6aca0096298">I updated a port I maintain,
pqiv</a>.
I received a <a href="https://chown.me/iota/dmesg/dmesg-x1.txt">generous donation</a> from <a href="https://twitter.com/mischapeters">Mischa
Peters</a> so I installed OpenBSD on it (thanks
to jasper@ for carrying it!).</p>
<p>Installing OpenBSD was not that trivial because I didn't have any USB key and
the wired NIC required an adapter which I didn't have and the wifi NIC required
a firmware to work. Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/poolporg">our marvelous
organizer</a> for providing me a USB key and stsp@ for
lending me a USB NIC (which later <a href="https://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article;sid=20180430190108">krw@ used to debug a dhclient
bug</a>!). After that,
I installed the packages I use, rsync'ed my home from my work laptop I was
using until then like a lil' pig and felt immediately at home!</p>
<p>I really begin the ports hackathon on Tuesday when I committed an update for
py-setuptools. I had already <a href="./b2k16.html">updated them</a> 18 months ago. It was
easy to do it because I already did all the work a few weeks ago. My plan was
to commit it before the hackathon but the clang6 fallout decided otherwise. I
needed this setuptools to port upt. <a href="https://framagit.org/upt">upt</a> is a
"modular tool that helps people package software from PyPI/CPAN/etc. to
OpenBSD/GNU Guix/etc". It's made by a <a href="https://perso.aquilenet.fr/~steap/">very good friend of
mine</a> so I sent him a bunch of <a href="https://framagit.org/upt/upt-rubygems/commit/ccb5c2c1f9df2c383a02b2297f0354c3692757b4">really
nice</a>
<a href="https://framagit.org/upt/upt-cpan/commit/893ef4aed42a121fb2adb6412dd9c91f81a8e8f0">diffs</a>.</p>
<p>I imported spdx and spdx-lookup which are a database of licenses and a tool to
query it. That's the tool upt is using to
<a href="https://framagit.org/upt/upt/blob/master/upt/licenses.py#L702">guess</a> the
license used. Then, I decided to call it a day. The morning was stressful, and rain was forecasted for the next few days. This pushed me to go see the city. I went to
see <a href="https://www.lesmachines-nantes.fr/en/"><em>Les Machines De L'Île</em></a>. Sadly the
Elephant was sick so I couldn't ride him. He was fine enough to spit water on
kids though. What makes me even sadder is that I didn't photograph the
billboard saying it was sick. It would have been such a cool error page
for when PostgreSQL is down!</p>
<p>I also visited <em>Le Chateau des Ducs de Bretagne</em> and <em>Le Jardin des Plantes</em>
which both were awesome with the nice blue sky I had. It was also funny to
notice that the people of Nantes try to trick people, with putting "de Bretagne"
in various names, into thinking that Nantes is in Bretagne while it is not.
Yup, I'm pretty happy to have a static blog without any comments system so
there won't be any hateful reactions visible here :-)</p>
<p>Once I got back to the hackroom, I review-n-committed a couple of diffs for
python ports. I updated again pqiv as they released another bugfix release and
did some reviews for the <a href="https://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article;sid=20180429101745">boar port from solene@</a>.</p>
<p>I spent Wednesday only doing reviews for other devs—facette, influxdb for
landry@, and several python ports for pvk@. At 5 pm I was fed up, so I went to
the supermarket and bought some Belgian beers (<em>Trappe Quadrupel</em> and
<em>Westmalle</em> mainly but also some <em>Chimay</em>). Once drunk I went to play ping-pong
with other French hackers. A few hours—and less alcohol in my blood—later, I
finally updated my main server to OpenBSD 6.3 which went fine.</p>
<p>I also looked at setting <code>PORTS_PRIVSEP=Yes</code> being one of the <a href="https://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article;sid=20180429190200">"new
converts"</a>, but I
had some <a href="https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-ports-cvs&amp;m=152466817003263&amp;w=2">problems</a>
(this commit message actually makes me laugh so much) so I eventually decided to
rollback. Now, however, I know which permissions to set if I want to enable it
again so that's cool!</p>
<p>Thursday was low-hanging-fruit day. One of the commits renamed a package and so
I needed to add a quirks entry. I did all of it on my own and I was glad to see
how much more comfortable I was after two years (I got my <em>commit bit</em> shortly
before p2k16 which happened 2 years ago).</p>
<p>Until Friday, I didn't submit upt because I was waiting for Cyril to send an
email about it. He finally sent
<a href="https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-ports&amp;m=152478073001511&amp;w=2">it</a> so I submitted
it while replying to his email. I had already talked about it to landry@
because he wanted to port a dozen of python ports. I told him this tool
could help him so he was eager to try it. I finally imported it after a couple
of back and forth between landry@ and I.</p>
<p>Saturday was my last day as I was traveling on Sunday. I reviewed
collectd/liboping for landry@, looked at the new
<a href="https://www.palletsprojects.com/blog/flask-1-0-released/">Flask</a>. During
p2k16, I talked with eric@ about ports where he was listed as maintainer. This
time I succeeded in convincing him that his time was better spent on OpenSMTPD so
there was no need to for him to be listed as maintainer. My final commit for
p2k18 was freeing him from the ports tree :-) </p>
<p>A while ago, I bought two <a href="./playing-with-the-pine64.html">pine64</a> but they
were not that useful for my use cases—too slow and unreliable. For a few weeks,
semarie was using one of them remotely to work on rust/arm64. But when it
stopped working, I had to investigate which didn't please my laziness. I offered
him to take one and give it to him. He gladly accepted and then it was quickly <a href="https://marc.info/?l=openbsd-bugs&amp;m=152526381422932&amp;w=2">put to
use</a>!</p>
<p>It was very nice to see Nantes and my fellow OpenBSD hackers again. I could commit
the diffs I had for a few weeks and reviewed some submissions that enhance what
you can <code>pkg_add</code> on OpenBSD. Thanks to gilles@ for all the organization and to
Epitech for hosting us again and to the OpenBSD Foundation for the fundings!</p>
