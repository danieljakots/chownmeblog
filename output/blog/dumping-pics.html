<p>A few years ago I bought a camera (a Canon 100D) and since that I take
pictures from time to time. I go through all the pics I take and I
pick the best then I enhance them a bit with rawtherapee and finally I
post them on <a href="http://piks.chown.me">500px</a>. This process is a bit
<em>relou</em> so I don't often do it. Of course I don't always have my camera
with me, but I do have my phone most of the time.</p>
<p>I take a lot of pictures with my phone and I sometimes post them on
some social networks. All these social networks I'm on, are based on
ephemeral publications so after a <strong>short</strong> while, the stuff goes out
of your mind and you never see it again.</p>
<p>I looked for a self-hostable solution. I found PHP-based software like
leetchi and piwigo but I wasn't fond of these. I looked at static
generators as I already use one (pelican) for this blog. Sadly, there
are maaaanyyyy of them for blogs and text-based publications but for
gallery there very few static generators. Finally I found
<a href="https://github.com/saimn/sigal">sigal</a> which is maintained, written
in python, quite nice and very straight forward to use.</p>
<p>Here's the result: <a href="https://pics.chown.me/">https://pics.chown.me/</a> (with among other themes,
as of now, 229 pics of my delicious kitten <em>Jean Canard</em>).</p>
