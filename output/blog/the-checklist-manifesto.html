<p><b>Posted on 2018-06-01</b></p>
<p>What is the best way to improve the quality of your actions? According to the
author of the book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Checklist_Manifesto"><em>The Checklist
Manifesto</em></a>, it's with
checklists.</p>
<p>A few months ago, a <a href="https://instinctive.eu/">friend</a> wrote <a href="https://instinctive.eu/weblog/0AC-perte-de-memoire-II">a blog
article</a> about how her
memory began to fail her. <a href="https://blog.pasithee.fr/">Another friend</a>
<a href="https://instinctive.eu/weblog/0AC-perte-de-memoire-II#VXBU66HpV1Ds">commented</a> that
she wrote a checklist to avoid forgetting anything before a commit, after
having read <em>The Checklist Manifesto</em>.  Another passion of mine is airplanes.
In the aviation world, there are checklists for everything. I was curious
what this book could say about this subject so I read it.</p>
<p>While reading the book was pleasant, if the author talked only about checklists,
I think it could have been only one chapter. The other things he wrote about
are communications and sharing—or spreading—responsibilities. These topics are also
very important but out of the scope in my opinion.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atul_Gawande">Atul Gawande</a> (the author)
is a surgeon, so obviously he talks about surgery but not only. For instance,
he talks about how aviation and construction firms started using checklists, who
writes them, and what they cover.</p>
<p>But why make checklists? The author
explains that over the last centuries we have learned many many things, but we
sometimes fail at doing them.  Checklists are there to lower our fail rate.
They also help to be faster and more methodical.</p>
<p>Checklists don't improve our skills, they improve results. They are guards
against basic errors and oversights.</p>
<p>That sounds good, doesn't it? So how does one a do a good checklist? The author
gives a <em>rule of thumb</em>. The checklist must:</p>
<ul>
<li>be between 5 and 9 elements—it should take between 60 and 90 seconds to complete</li>
<li>have a clear <em>pause point</em> i.e. when to go through the checklist</li>
<li>be short and precise, they're not a how-to</li>
<li>have a publication date and be occasionally revised</li>
</ul>
<p>Atul Gawande lists two kinds of checklist:</p>
<ul>
<li>do-confirm: you do your stuff and once you think you're good, you go
through the checklist to verify you didn't forget anything</li>
<li>read-do: you do what the checklist says you have to do while reading it</li>
</ul>
<p>Checklists can be done during team briefing and it has the added benefit that it
improves communication among the team.</p>
<p>I liked this book and if you're curious about stories behind checklists, you
should definitely read it!</p>
