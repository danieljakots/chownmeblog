      <h1>Welcome on my blog!</h1>
    </a>
  </header>

  <br>
<p>Five years ago I wrote about <a href="./yubikey.html">using a yubikey</a> on OpenBSD.  The
only problem with doing this is that there's no validation server available on
OpenBSD, so you need to use a different OTP slot for each machine. (You don't
want to risk a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replay_attack">replay attack</a> if
someone succeeds in capturing an OTP on one machine, right?)  Yubikey has two
OTP slots per device, so you would need a yubikey for every two machines with
which you'd like to use it. You could use a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastion_host">bastion</a>—and use only one
yubikey—but I don't like the SPOF aspect of a bastion. YMMV.</p>
<p>After <a href="./my-recent-journey-with-2FA.html">I played with TOTP</a>, I wanted to use
them as a 2FA for ssh. At the time of writing, we can't do that using only the
tools in base. This article focuses on OpenBSD; if you use another operating
system, here are two <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq4.html">handy</a>
<a href="https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/6.3/amd64/INSTALL.amd64">links</a>.</p>
<h1>Seed configuration</h1>
<p>The first thing we need to do is to install the software which will be used to
verify the OTPs we submit.</p>
<p>~~~</p>
<h1>pkg_add login_oath</h1>
<p>~~~</p>
<p>We need to create a <em>secret</em> - aka, the <em>seed</em> - that will be used to calculate
the Time-based One-Time Passwords. We should make sure no one can read or
change it.</p>
<p>~~~
$ openssl rand -hex 20 &gt; ~/.totp-key
$ chmod 400 ~/.totp-key
~~~</p>
<p>Now we have a hexadecimal key, but apps usually <a href="https://github.com/mattrubin/Authenticator/blob/develop/Authenticator/Source/TokenEntryForm.swift#L214">want a base32
secret</a>.
I initially wrote a small script to do the conversion.</p>
<p>While writing this article, I took the opportunity to improve it. When I
initially wrote this utility for my use,
<a href="https://github.com/lincolnloop/python-qrcode">python-qrcode</a> hadn't yet been
imported to the OpenBSD ports/packages system. It's easy to install now, so
let's use it.</p>
<p>Here's the improved version. It will ask for the hex key and output the secret
as a base32-encoded string, both with and without spacing so you can copy-paste
it into your password manager or easily retype it. It will then ask for the
information needed to generate a <em>QR code</em>. Adding our new OTP secret to any
mobile app using the QR code will be super easy!</p>

<p>You can fetch this script using <code>ftp
https://chown.me/iota/blog/totp-hex-to-qrcode.py</code>.  (The code isn't in any of
my public repositories for
<a href="https://chown.me/iota/blog/issues-public-repo.jpg">reasons</a>).</p>
<p>We can check to make sure everything went smoothly by comparing the code
provided by your mobile app to one generated by <em>oathtool</em> at the same time.
The <em>oathtool</em> binary is provided by the package <em>oath-toolkit</em> (which is the
dependency needed by <em>login_oath</em>). <em>oathtool</em> accepts the seed in either
hexadecimal or base32 format.</p>
<p>~~~
$ oathtool --totp 0123456789abcdef0123
054640
$ oathtool --totp -b AERUKZ4JVPG66AJD
054640
~~~</p>
<p><em>0123456789abcdef0123</em> is the <em>seed</em> in hexadecimal format (as in
<code>~/.totp-key</code>) and <em>AERUKZ4JVPG66AJD</em> is the same data, but base32-encoded.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you just want to do the hex -&gt; b32 conversion, <em>login_oath</em>'s
README gives a Perl example (but it is not an unreadable one-liner, so you may
not want to use it):</p>
<p>~~~
Some tokens (e.g. Google Authenticator) require secrets in base32 format;
you can convert them with p5-Convert-Base32:</p>
<p>use Convert::Base32;
my $s = pack('H*', '99d12448129d1e8192e063d64714209137a13864');
print encode_base32($s)."\n";
~~~</p>
<h1>System configuration</h1>
<p>We can now move to the configuration of the system to put our new TOTP to use.
As you might guess, it's going to be quite close to what we did with the
yubikey.</p>
<p>We need to tweak <code>login.conf</code>. <strong>Be careful</strong> and keep a root shell open at all
times.  The few times I broke my OpenBSD were because I messed with login.conf
without showing enough care.</p>
<p>After the lines:</p>
<p>~~~</p>
<h1>Default allowed authentication styles for authentication type ftp</h1>
<p>auth-ftp-defaults:auth-ftp=passwd:
~~~</p>
<p>we add:</p>
<p>~~~</p>
<h1>Default allowed authentication styles for authentication type ssh</h1>
<p>auth-ssh-defaults:auth-ssh=-totp:
~~~</p>
<p>and inside the class of the user account for which TOTP is being set, we add
the line <code>:tc=auth-ssh-defaults:\</code>. For instance, in my case it's:</p>
<p>~~~
staff:\
        :datasize-cur=1536M:\
        :datasize-max=infinity:\
        :maxproc-max=512:\
        :maxproc-cur=256:\
        :ignorenologin:\
        :requirehome@:\
        :tc=auth-ssh-defaults:\
        :tc=default:
~~~</p>
<p>(Hint: it's the penultimate line). You can check the class of your user using
<code>id -c</code>.</p>
<h1>sshd configuration</h1>
<p>Again, keeping a root shell around decreases the risk of losing access to the
system and being locked outside.</p>
<p>A good standard is to use <code>PasswordAuthentication no</code> and to use public key
only. Except... have a guess what the <em>P</em> stands for in <em>TOTP</em>.  Yes, congrats,
you guessed it!</p>
<p>We need to switch to <code>PasswordAuthentication yes</code>. However, if we made this
change alone, sshd would then accept a public key OR a password (which are TOTP
because of our <em>login.conf</em>). 2FA uses both at the same time.</p>
<p>To inform sshd we intend to use both, we need to set <code>AuthenticationMethods
publickey,password</code>. This way, the user trying to login will first need to
perform the traditional publickey authentication. Once that's done, ssh will
prompt for a password and the user will need to submit a valid TOTP for the
system.</p>
<p>We could do this the other way around, but I think bots could try passwords,
wasting resources. Evaluated in this order, failing to provide a public key leads to
sshd immediately declining your attempt.</p>
<p>Here's the diff of the output when testing with <code>ssh -v</code> using both public-key-only authentication and two-factor authentication:</p>
<p>~~~
-debug1: Authentication succeeded (publickey).
+Authenticated with partial success.
+debug1: Authentications that can continue: password
+debug1: Next authentication method: password
+danj@198.51.100.12's password:
+debug1: Authentication succeeded (password).
~~~</p>
<h1>Improving security without impacting UX</h1>
<p>My phone has a long enough password that most of the time, I fail to type it
correctly on the first try. Of course, if I had to unlock my phone, launch my
TOTP app and use my keyboard to enter what I see on my phone's screen, I would
quickly disable 2FA.</p>
<p>To find a balance, I have whitelisted certain IP addresses and users. If I
connect from a particular IP address or as a specific user, I don't want to go
through 2FA. For some users, I might not even enable 2FA.</p>
<p>To whitelist, we can use the <em>Match</em> keyword. Here are two basic examples:</p>
<p>~~~
Match User git
    AuthenticationMethods publickey
~~~</p>
<p>~~~
Match Address 203.0.113.47 # VPN
    AuthenticationMethods publickey
~~~</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>To sum up, we covered how to create a seed, how to perform a hexadecimal to
base32 conversion and how to create a <em>QR code</em> for mobile applications. We
configured the login system with <em>login.conf</em> so that ssh authentication uses
the TOTP login system, and we told sshd to ask for both the public key and the
Time-based One-Time Password. Now you should be all set to use two-factor
ssh authentication on OpenBSD!</p>
