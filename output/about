<h2>Hey, I'm Daniel</h2>
<p>I work as a system and network engineer in Montreal where I have been living since the end
of 2016. In my spare time, I <a href="http://oxide.org/cvs/danj.html">contribute</a> to
<a href="https://www.openbsd.org">OpenBSD</a>, I
<a href="https://github.com/danieljakots">develop</a> in Python, and when it's hotter than
10 Celsius, I ride my <a href="https://twitter.com/Vigdis_/status/857378539057893378">single
speed</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://pics.chown.me/Jean-Canard/">My cat</a> goes by the name of <em>Jean Canard</em>.</p>
<p>I've been a board member of the <a href="https://qix.ca/">QIX</a>, the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_exchange_point">Internet Exchange Point</a>
in Montreal.</p>
<p>Previously, I've been involved in a couple of non-profits such as
<a href="https://www.franciliens.net/">Franciliens.net</a>, <a href="https://www.ffdn.org/">FFDN</a>,
and <a href="https://nos-oignons.net/">Nos oignons</a>. At the time I was living in
France. Before I came to Montreal, I lived for eight years in Normandy
(Caen and Rouen) and one year in Brittany (Rennes).</p>
<p>I have the Canadian and French citizenships.</p>

<h2>Corporate Biography</h2>
<p>Daniel is a Python Developer focusing on DevOps methodologies. Curious by
nature, his interests lie in the development of web applications, as well as
their deployment, performance optimization, availability and security.</p>
<p>During his studies, Daniel cultivated his passion for Information Technology.
He first pursued the world of the command line on Ubuntu, then strove to
develop his skills in system administration, followed by network
administration. Heavily motivated toward leveraging his skills for community
enrichment, Daniel has been involved in various non-profit organizations
working to provide better Internet access.</p>
<p>Daniel began his professional life as a system and network administrator in a
server management company. Servicing small and medium-sized businesses, the
focus of this work was technical administration for businesses lacking in-house
resources, such as communications agencies. Managing the large number of
servers required to meet customer needs helped him to recognize the utility of
automation in deployment and server management.</p>
<p>Having reached an end to the learning opportunities available within the
non-profit sector, Daniel turned to open source contribution to further develop
his skills. He began to submit patches with improvements to the OpenBSD
project. After a year, Daniel was invited to join the small team of OpenBSD
developers, and now works with developers worldwide to improve and maintain the
project.</p>
<p>Seeking a life change, Daniel took advantage of his dual national status and
emigrated to Montreal. He continued to work as a system and network
administrator, managing Ansible machines running OpenBSD that manage the
network for a small host and network operator. To accomplish various tasks, he
developed and deployed Python code at every opportunity.</p>
<p>Eventually, Daniel decided to stop resisting his passion for Python and open
source communities. He switched his focus to the world of development, seeking
to bridge his primary interests and better understand operations from another
perspective.</p>
