## Hey, I'm Daniel

I work as a tech lead, in a
[SRE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Site_Reliability_Engineering) team. I live
in Montreal where I have been living since the end of 2016. In my spare time, I
[contribute](http://oxide.org/cvs/danj.html) to
[OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org), I
[develop](https://github.com/danieljakots) in Python and
[Golang](https://codeberg.org/danj). When the streets aren't icy, I ride
my [bike](https://dumpster.chown.me/mastodon/media_attachments/files/109/009/662/860/060/315/original/8bc678094d759cbc.png).

[My cat](https://pics.chown.me/Jean-Canard/) goes by the name of *Jean Canard*.

I've been a board member of the [QIX](https://qix.ca/), the
[Internet Exchange Point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_exchange_point)
in Montreal.

Previously, I've been involved in a couple of non-profits such as
[Franciliens.net](https://www.franciliens.net/), [FFDN](https://www.ffdn.org/),
and [Nos oignons](https://nos-oignons.net/). At the time I was living in
France. Before I came to Montreal, I lived for eight years in Normandy
(Caen and Rouen) and one year in Brittany (Rennes).

I have the Canadian and French citizenships.
