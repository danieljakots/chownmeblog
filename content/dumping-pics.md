Title: Dumping pics

A few years ago I bought a camera (a Canon 100D) and since that I take
pictures from time to time. I go through all the pics I take and I
pick the best then I enhance them a bit with rawtherapee and finally I
post them on [500px](http://piks.chown.me). This process is a bit
*relou* so I don't often do it. Of course I don't always have my camera
with me, but I do have my phone most of the time.

I take a lot of pictures with my phone and I sometimes post them on
some social networks. All these social networks I'm on, are based on
ephemeral publications so after a **short** while, the stuff goes out
of your mind and you never see it again.

I looked for a self-hostable solution. I found PHP-based software like
leetchi and piwigo but I wasn't fond of these. I looked at static
generators as I already use one (pelican) for this blog. Sadly, there
are maaaanyyyy of them for blogs and text-based publications but for
gallery there very few static generators. Finally I found
[sigal](https://github.com/saimn/sigal) which is maintained, written
in python, quite nice and very straight forward to use.

Here's the result: <https://pics.chown.me/> (with among other themes,
as of now, 229 pics of my delicious kitten *Jean Canard*).
