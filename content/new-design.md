Title: New design

In June this blog will be five years old. Since [I created it](./blog.html), it
has had the same design. A few weeks ago I looked for a new theme. I found
[pelican-blue](https://github.com/Parbhat/pelican-blue) which I liked. For my
first theme, I took it from someone and shortly after someone took it from me.
This time I wanted something more unique.

I took pelican-blue and hammered the CSS so people would notice I love the
color [*red*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red). At home, my sheets are red, my bath towel is red, my couch is
red, my curtains are red. Even the ribbon Jean Canard plays with is [red](https://pics.chown.me/Jean-Canard/IMG_0675.JPG).

I noticed a couple of things that were broken with the theme so I had to fix
them. Now I have to go back to my commit log to tell the original author as a
way to contribute back.

At first, my blog URL was `blog.chown.me`. Then I wanted https but I couldn't
have another domain because back then free (and valid—hi cacert) certificates
weren't a thing, I moved it to `chown.me/blog`. To welcome stalk^Wvisitors I
had a landing page on `chown.me`. Now, however, I changed my mind and I prefer
to have my blog index page directly on `chown.me`.

I wanted to break as few links as possible—ain't nobody got time to write the
otherwise needed haproxy redirection. I think I tweaked enough of my
[pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) config file so that most of them are fine.
Not all of them are; I had to break one or two because of translations.
Fortunately, I was lazy enough to translate only a handful of articles so the
breakage is minimal.

To fix some past mistakes I had to go through old articles. It was a weird
feeling to read my younger self. I wouldn't advise to read them haha. They're in
French anyway.

One of my 2018 New Year's resolution was to write more blog articles. With not a
single one for the first quarter, you can guess it's not my best
accomplishment. But hopefully, I'll finally do it.
