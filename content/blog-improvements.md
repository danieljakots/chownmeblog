This article annouces a new version of this blog. Available right now!

In my [previous article](./pics2html), I said "Seeing how easy writing a static
site generator was made me want to write one for my blog." and that's what I
did! I initially wrote a very long article to tell the whole story but then I
thought I don't want to have such a long article here. Here's a short version.

Basically I used a small subset of all the features pelican provides. Writing
my own software gives me bigger control. Howerver, with great power comes great
ownership of the code, since I doubt anyone else is going to touch my code. But
I like it.

Here's a short list of changes:

* Clean CSS because it's way more simple.
* Related to the previous point, the text is always centered. It was not
  completely easy to achieve this, hence the joke in the footer.
* HTML headers (like h2 and h3) have now HTML anchors to ease sharing specific
  part
* No more sharing buttons. I doubt they were used (but what do I know) and copy
  pasting a link is not that hard. Less cluter on the interface so I like it.
* I have a contact page. I hope it will make the experience better for
  everyone.
* No breakage. I was careful to keep the same link for most of the thing. Please let me know otherwise!
* [Clean URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_URL). But to keep everything
  working as before, all pages will be reachable with the .html extension as
  well.
* New pygment style (for code inlined) which I think is nicer.
