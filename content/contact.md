Title: Contact

Please refrain from contacting me for any offer. I'm not interested in linking any
of your shitty content anywhere in my web presence nor in whatever that
includes the words "guests posts".

If you are friendly and not seeking profit, you can contact me by email with
the local part being "blog". Otherwise you can `/query` me on irc under the
nick Vigdis (but I may be connected only to freenode). I'm also on the
[fediverse](https://awoo.chown.me/@vigdis).

While I have a twitter account, it is not actively monitored so for emergency,
please dial 911 or the [appropriate
number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_telephone_number).
