Please refrain from contacting me with offers. I'm not interested in linking to
any of your shitty content as part of my web presence, nor do I want to receive
anything that includes the words "guest post."

If you are friendly and not seeking profit, you can contact me by email, using
"blog" as the
[local-part](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email_address#Syntax). Otherwise
you can `/query` me on irc under the nick Vigdis (but I may be connected only
to freenode). I'm also on the [fediverse](https://awoo.chown.me/@vigdis).

While I have a twitter account, it is not actively monitored, so for
emergencies, please dial 911 or the [appropriate
number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_telephone_number).
